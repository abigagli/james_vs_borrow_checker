This is just a repo full of compilation errors I get from the Rust borrow checker. In the hope that:
1. Someone might help me fix them
2. They might help someone else

This is a workspace, containing a crate for each error. The files are minimal examples in 
binaries, with the solutions, where I have any, in the /bin directory.

If you have better solutions, please submit PRs to the /bin directory.

Thank you!
